                            Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services over the Internet using a web browser. Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the same product's availability and pricing at different e-retailers. As of 2016, costumers can shop online using a range of different computers and devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and smartphones.

They focused on shopping motivations and found that variety of products available and the perceived convenience of the buying online experience were significantly motivating factors.
